    ##Get Started!

    #About the User
The ideal user would be someone who would like to view code terms and memorize and/or better understand the term's meaning. When learning to code, there are so many new terms to learn along the way, and using this Vocab app would help to keep track of which terms the user feels is important to remember. 
The user can create their own account to view only their vocab terms that they choose to save. They can create a new vocab card with the following details: vocab title, definition, and tech language of the term. The date and time that it was submitted will be on the card as well.
The user can click on the 'view' button to view one card at a time. The user can click the 'delete' button to delete each vocab card. The user can creat a new vocab entry by clicking the 'create' button at the top. The user can also click on one of the language filter buttons (html, javascript, css) to view vocab cards that fall under that languageTech category. 
The search bar can also be used to search for certain titles, definition words, or tech language that the user has in their personal account.

    #Features
